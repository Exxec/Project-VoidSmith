# VoidSmith Live Roadmap

This is the authoritative plan for current work. Implementation and tests are
authoritative for behavior already shipped. Historical calibration logs,
installation measurements, and local review notes are deliberately not part of
the distributable repository.

## Current scope

VoidSmith is an offline, deterministic, source-read-only assistant for:

- per-ship fitting, validation, generation, and minimal-change refit;
- faction capability analysis and Native / Retrofit / Acquisition
  recommendations;
- locked-selection Fleet Support recommendations; and
- static Scenario / Mission alignment against generic or user-declared
  capability targets.

It does not simulate combat, optimize a whole fleet, alter source game/mod
files, or make campaign-inventory or market-availability decisions.

## Completed milestones

| Milestone | Status | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Scanner, normalized data, provenance, and cache | Complete with limits | Read-only parsing of installed core/mod sources; unknown and malformed data remain explicit. |
| Validation, derived state, generation, and refit | Complete with limits | Three-state legality is separate from quality; refit is bounded and preserves locks. |
| Faction capability and recommendations | Complete with limits | Data-driven capability gaps, diversity, confidence, and Why-Not paths; guidance remains advisory. |
| Desktop workspaces and export | Complete with limits | GUI calls backend services without duplicating rules; exports write only compatibility-mod output. |
| Fleet Support | Complete with limits | Selected ships stay locked; complementary individual additions are ranked with composition synergy. |
| Scenario / Mission Advisor | Complete with limits | Generic templates and custom capability targets report static alignment and can feed deficient needs to Fleet Support. |
| Scenario workflow handoff | Complete with limits | Portable snapshots, visible scenario-targeted cards, and a revalidated Scenario Fit handoff to the bounded generator; “Stop Waiting” safely discards a pending GUI result. |

## Next priorities

1. Define a safe, read-only campaign-save discovery boundary. Do not add
   campaign mutation, inventory planning, or undocumented save semantics.
2. Evaluate bounded officer and deployment-point advisory views only where
   parseable evidence supports them; keep them separate from legality and
   combat-outcome claims.
3. Continue calibration and generic mod qualification using local,
   hash-bound, ignored fixtures. Add adapters only for supported, genuinely
   mod-specific static semantics.
4. Improve release clarity, portable-build verification, and GUI explanation
   paths without broadening into whole-fleet optimization.

## Latest implementation note

The Scenario Advisor now saves and restores only user-declared locked
selections, capability targets, pressures, and advisor constraints. Scenario
recommendation cards feed a separate **Generate Scenario Fit** action, which
re-runs the same scenario assessment and accepts only a currently shortlisted
candidate before invoking the ordinary bounded generator. Generated variants,
not the scenario card, retain normal validation results. The GUI shows an
indeterminate progress dialog for scenario evaluation and fit generation. Its
**Stop Waiting** action safely suppresses result delivery but does not claim
to interrupt the backend: no safe cooperative checkpoints currently exist in
those deterministic analysis calls, so the read-only work finishes before its
thread is released.

## RC1 limits carried forward

Campaign-save discovery remains intentionally unimplemented until a documented,
read-only save format and user-selected save location can be supported without
guessing. The normalized hull schema currently has no deployment-point field,
and the application has no parseable campaign officer/skill state. Existing
knowledge-pack officer notes remain presentational guidance only. These gaps
cannot be converted into recommendation or combat-outcome claims for RC1.

## Engineering constraints

- See `AGENTS.md` for repository, source-safety, and distribution boundaries.
- See `FORMAL_SPECIFICATION.md` and `DATA_SCHEMA.md` for contracts.
- See `GAP_RECOMMENDATION_ENGINE.md` for recommendation behavior and
  `docs/FLEET_SUPPORT_ADVISOR.md` for Fleet Support scope.
- New heuristic changes require a versioned heuristic set, rationale,
  documentation, and regression coverage.
- Unknown scripted or runtime-dependent behavior remains unknown; it must not
  be guessed into legality or quality.
